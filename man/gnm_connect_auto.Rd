\usage{
gnm_connect_auto(
  net,
  layers = NULL,
  tolerance = 0.001,
  cost = 1,
  inverse_cost = 1,
  directed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A \link{gnm_network} object (must be open).}

\item{layers}{Character vector of layer names to consider. If NULL, uses
all class layers.}

\item{tolerance}{Spatial tolerance in SRS units. For geographic CRS
(degrees), a value like 0.000001 corresponds to ~0.1m at mid-latitudes.}

\item{cost}{Forward edge cost (default 1).}

\item{inverse_cost}{Inverse (reverse) edge cost (default 1).}

\item{directed}{If TRUE, edges are directed (source → target only).
Default FALSE (bidirectional).}
}
\value{
\code{net} invisibly (for piping).

\description{
Connects point features to line features by matching line endpoints
to nearby points within the specified tolerance. Each line whose start
and end points both fall within tolerance of a point feature creates
a graph edge.
