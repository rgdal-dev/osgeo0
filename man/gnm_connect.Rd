\item{net}{A \link{gnm_network} object (must be open).}

\item{src}{Source feature GFID (node).}

\item{tgt}{Target feature GFID (node).}

\item{connector}{Connector feature GFID (edge), or -1 for a virtual edge.}

\item{cost}{Forward edge cost.}

\item{inverse_cost}{Inverse edge cost.}

\item{directed}{If TRUE, edge is directed source → target only.}

\description{
Creates a graph connection between two features identified by their
Global Feature IDs. The features can be in the same or different layers.
