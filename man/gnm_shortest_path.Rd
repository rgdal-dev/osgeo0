\title{Find the shortest path between two features}
\usage{
gnm_shortest_path(net, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A \link{gnm_network} object (must be open).}

\item{from}{Source feature GFID.}

\item{to}{Target feature GFID.}
}
\value{
A \link{gnm_path} object containing the path features.
}
\description{
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two
features identified by their Global Feature IDs. The result is
eagerly materialised as a data.frame with wk geometry — no Python
references are retained.
